# python_package_template

This is a template repository meant to easily setup python projects.
To use it simply click the green "Use this Template" Button to setup your own repository with the same structure.

The repository will automatically perform continous integration workflows as defined in the .github directory.
The docs folder already contains a sphinx autodocumentation setup that can be used to automatically generate documentation from docstrings.
