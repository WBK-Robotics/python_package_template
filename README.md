# python_package_template

This is a template repository meant to easily set up python projects.
To use it simply click the green "Use this Template" Button to set up your own repository with the same structure.

The repository will automatically perform continuous integration workflows as defined in the .github directory.
The docs folder already contains a sphinx auto documentation setup that can be used to automatically generate documentation from docstrings.
